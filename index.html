        <h2>Winter Weather in St. Johns</h2>
        <p>St. Johns typically experiences snow several times each winter season, though accumulation varies
          significantly year to year. The neighborhood's lower elevation near the Willamette River sometimes means less
          snow accumulation compared to Portland's west hills.</p>

        <h3>Snow Season Timeline</h3>
        <p>In the Portland area, snow is most common between December and February, with occasional events in November
          and March. The National Weather Service monitors conditions closely and issues winter weather advisories when
          snow is expected.</p>

        <h3>What to Expect During Snow Events</h3>
        <p>When it does snow in St. Johns, residents should be prepared for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Road conditions:</strong> Bridge approaches and overpasses freeze first. The St. Johns Bridge can
            become hazardous quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transit:</strong> TriMet may reduce or suspend bus service on hills and in adverse
            conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature fluctuations:</strong> Portland snow often occurs near 32°F, leading to freeze-thaw
            cycles.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed precipitation:</strong> Rain, sleet, and freezing rain often accompany or follow snow
            events.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Staying Informed</h3>
        <p>This website pulls data directly from the National Weather Service API, ensuring you have access to official
          forecasts and warnings. We update conditions in real-time, so you can check back anytime to see if snow is
          currently falling in St. Johns.</p>
