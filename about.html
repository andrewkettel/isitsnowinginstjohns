        <h1>About Is It Snowing in St. Johns</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Is It Snowing in St. Johns, your simple, straightforward source for real-time winter weather
            information in Portland's St. Johns neighborhood.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We created this site to answer one simple question that matters to St. Johns residents during winter: Is it
            snowing right now? No complicated weather apps, no endless scrolling through forecasts—just a quick, clear
            answer when you need it most.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our site pulls live weather data directly from the National Weather Service (NWS) API, specifically for the
            St. Johns area grid coordinates. Every time you visit, we check the current conditions and forecast to
            determine if snow is falling in your neighborhood.</p>

        <p>The data comes from official government weather stations and is the same information used by meteorologists
            and weather services across the country. We simply present it in the most straightforward way possible.</p>

        <h2>Why St. Johns?</h2>
        <p>St. Johns is a unique neighborhood in North Portland with its own microclimate characteristics. Located near
            the Willamette River and at a lower elevation than many other Portland neighborhoods, St. Johns sometimes
            experiences different weather conditions than the rest of the city.</p>

        <p>During winter storms, residents often wonder if they're seeing snow, rain, or a mix of both. This site
            provides localized information specific to the St. Johns area, rather than general Portland-wide forecasts.
        </p>

        <h2>Weather Data Source</h2>
        <p>All weather information on this site comes from the National Weather Service, part of the National Oceanic
            and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NWS provides free, accurate, and timely weather forecasts and
            warnings for the United States.</p>

        <p>We use their public API to access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current weather conditions</li>
            <li>Short-term and extended forecasts</li>
            <li>Temperature and wind information</li>
            <li>Precipitation forecasts</li>
            <li>Weather warnings and advisories</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Portland Snow</h2>
        <p>Snow in Portland is relatively uncommon but memorable when it occurs. The city typically sees snowfall a few
            times each winter, with significant accumulation happening less frequently. St. Johns, being at a lower
            elevation near the river, may see less accumulation than Portland's west hills.</p>

        <p>When snow does fall, it often comes with complications. Portland's temperate climate means snow events
            frequently occur near the freezing point, leading to mixed precipitation (rain, sleet, freezing rain) and
            challenging road conditions as ice forms on pavement.</p>

        <h2>Stay Informed</h2>
        <p>While our site provides a quick answer about current snow conditions, we encourage residents to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the full 7-day forecast on our homepage for upcoming weather</li>
            <li>Follow local news for winter weather advisories</li>
            <li>Monitor road conditions before traveling</li>
            <li>Sign up for emergency alerts from Portland's Office of Emergency Management</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>Special thanks to the National Weather Service for providing free, public access to weather data, and to the
            developers and maintainers of the NWS API that makes projects like this possible.</p>
