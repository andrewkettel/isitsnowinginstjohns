        <h1>St. Johns Winter Weather Preparedness Guide</h1>

        <p>Living in St. Johns means enjoying a mild Pacific Northwest climate most of the year, but winter can
            occasionally bring snow and ice that disrupts daily life. This guide will help you prepare for and safely
            navigate winter weather in our neighborhood.</p>

        <h2>Before the Storm: Preparation</h2>

        <h3>Essential Supplies to Keep on Hand</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food and Water:</strong> Stock at least 3-5 days of non-perishable food and one gallon of water
                per person per day</li>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Ensure you have adequate supplies of prescription medications</li>
            <li><strong>Flashlights and Batteries:</strong> Power outages are common during winter storms</li>
            <li><strong>First Aid Kit:</strong> Include basic medical supplies and any special items your family needs
            </li>
            <li><strong>Battery-powered or Hand-crank Radio:</strong> Stay informed if power goes out</li>
            <li><strong>Extra Blankets and Warm Clothing:</strong> Be prepared for heating disruptions</li>
            <li><strong>Ice Melt or Sand:</strong> For walkways and steps (avoid salt near plants)</li>
            <li><strong>Snow Shovel:</strong> Essential for clearing paths</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> St. Johns stores often sell out of winter supplies quickly when storms are
            forecast. Shop early in the season to avoid last-minute rushes.
        </div>

        <h3>Home Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Insulate exposed pipes to prevent freezing and bursting</li>
            <li>Know how to shut off your water main in case pipes freeze</li>
            <li>Trim tree branches that could fall on power lines or your home</li>
            <li>Check your heating system before winter arrives</li>
            <li>Clean gutters and downspouts to prevent ice dams</li>
            <li>Seal drafts around windows and doors</li>
            <li>Have a backup heating source (if using alternative heat, ensure proper ventilation)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>During a Winter Storm</h2>

        <h3>Staying Safe Indoors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay indoors during severe weather whenever possible</li>
            <li>Keep rooms warm but avoid overheating</li>
            <li>If power goes out, close off unused rooms to conserve heat</li>
            <li>Never use gas stoves, generators, or grills indoors due to carbon monoxide danger</li>
            <li>Let faucets drip slightly to prevent pipes from freezing</li>
            <li>Monitor weather updates regularly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Carbon Monoxide Warning:</strong> Never use generators, camp stoves, or charcoal grills indoors.
            These produce deadly carbon monoxide gas. Only use these devices outdoors in well-ventilated areas away from
            windows and doors.
        </div>

        <h3>Driving in Winter Weather</h3>
        <p>St. Johns streets can become treacherous during snow and ice events. Portland has limited snow removal
            equipment, and our hilly terrain makes conditions especially challenging.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoid driving if possible:</strong> Stay home unless travel is absolutely necessary</li>
            <li><strong>Bridge caution:</strong> The St. Johns Bridge freezes before road surfaces</li>
            <li><strong>Slow down:</strong> Reduce speed significantly and increase following distance</li>
            <li><strong>Black ice:</strong> Be especially cautious on bridges, overpasses, and shaded areas</li>
            <li><strong>All-wheel drive isn't enough:</strong> Even 4WD vehicles need winter tires in these conditions
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keep gas tank full:</strong> Prevents fuel line freeze and ensures you can run heater if
                stranded</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Car Emergency Kit</h3>
        <p>If you must drive, keep these items in your vehicle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ice scraper and snow brush</li>
            <li>Jumper cables</li>
            <li>Flashlight and extra batteries</li>
            <li>Blankets and extra warm clothing</li>
            <li>Water and non-perishable snacks</li>
            <li>First aid kit</li>
            <li>Sand or cat litter for traction</li>
            <li>Small shovel</li>
            <li>Phone charger (car adapter and/or power bank)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Walking Safely</h2>
        <p>Sidewalks in St. Johns can be hazardous during winter weather. Many areas lack sidewalks entirely, and ice
            can persist for days after a storm.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Wear boots with good traction</li>
            <li>Take small steps and walk slowly</li>
            <li>Keep hands free for balance (don't carry loads or put hands in pockets)</li>
            <li>Be extra cautious on hills and near the waterfront</li>
            <li>Watch for falling ice from trees and buildings</li>
            <li>Use crosswalks and make eye contact with drivers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Public Transit and Schools</h2>

        <h3>TriMet Service</h3>
        <p>TriMet often reduces or suspends service during severe weather, especially on hilly routes. The bus lines
            serving St. Johns may operate on snow routes or not run at all.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check TriMet alerts before traveling: <a href="https://trimet.org" target="_blank">trimet.org</a></li>
            <li>Plan alternative transportation or allow extra time</li>
            <li>Bus stops may not be cleared of snow</li>
            <li>MAX light rail typically continues operating but may have delays</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>School Closures</h3>
        <p>Portland Public Schools and other districts may close or delay opening during winter weather. Check your
            school's website or local news for closure information.</p>

        <h2>Community Resources</h2>

        <h3>Warming Centers</h3>
        <p>During severe weather, Portland opens warming centers throughout the city, including in St. Johns. These
            provide shelter, warmth, and sometimes meals during extreme conditions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call 211 or visit <a href="https://www.211info.org" target="_blank">211info.org</a> for current warming
                center locations</li>
            <li>Check the City of Portland's emergency management website</li>
            <li>St. Johns Community Center may serve as a warming center</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Emergency Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> 911</li>
            <li><strong>Non-emergency Police:</strong> 503-823-3333</li>
            <li><strong>Portland Bureau of Emergency Management:</strong> 503-823-4375</li>
            <li><strong>PGE Power Outages:</strong> 503-464-7777</li>
            <li><strong>NW Natural Gas Emergency:</strong> 800-882-3377</li>
            <li><strong>Water Bureau:</strong> 503-823-4874</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>After the Storm</h2>

        <h3>Safety Precautions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check on neighbors, especially elderly or vulnerable residents</li>
            <li>Clear snow and ice from sidewalks in front of your property (Portland requires this within 24 hours
                after snow stops)</li>
            <li>Watch for falling ice from roofs and trees</li>
            <li>Look out for downed power lines - stay at least 30 feet away and call 911</li>
            <li>Check your home for burst pipes or water damage</li>
            <li>Be patient with snow removal crews - Portland has limited equipment</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Good Neighbor Tip:</strong> If you're able, help elderly neighbors or those with disabilities by
            clearing their sidewalks or checking on their wellbeing. Community support is essential during winter
            storms.
        </div>

        <h2>Portland's Snow Response</h2>
        <p>Portland's snow removal priorities focus on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Major emergency response routes</li>
            <li>Transit routes and hills</li>
            <li>Major arterial streets</li>
            <li>Secondary streets</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Residential streets like those in many parts of St. Johns are low priority and may not be plowed. The city
            uses de-icing treatments on main routes but has limited equipment compared to cities that regularly
            experience snow.</p>

        <h2>Climate and Snow Frequency</h2>
        <p>Portland, including St. Johns, averages 4-5 inches of snow per year, though actual amounts vary
            significantly. Some winters bring no measurable snow, while others produce storms that paralyze the city.
        </p>

        <p>The unpredictability of Portland winters makes preparedness essential. Even if we only get one or two snow
            events per season, being ready ensures you can weather the storm safely and comfortably.</p>

        <h2>Stay Informed</h2>
        <p>Monitor weather conditions through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>National Weather Service: <a href="https://weather.gov/pqr" target="_blank">weather.gov/pqr</a></li>
            <li>Our website for current St. Johns conditions</li>
            <li>Local news stations</li>
            <li>City of Portland alerts</li>
            <li>Portland Bureau of Emergency Management Twitter/X account</li>
            <li>NOAA Weather Radio</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being prepared for winter weather in St. Johns isn't about fear—it's about being ready to handle whatever
            Mother Nature brings. With proper preparation and good judgment, you can safely navigate winter storms and
            enjoy the beauty of a snow-covered Portland.</p>
